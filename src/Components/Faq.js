                Different between lab grown diamond and natural diamond
              </Accordion.Header>
              <Accordion.Body>
                <p>
                  Lab-grown diamonds are created in a controlled lab environment
                  over weeks to months, while natural diamonds form naturally in
                  the Earth over millions of years.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lab-grown diamonds are generally more affordable,
                  environmentally friendly, and may have fewer inclusions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Natural diamonds, though often pricier, carry unique
                  characteristics from their natural formation and can be
                  identified by specific features.

                  and symmetry pertains to the alignment of facets, collectively
                  impacting a diamond's visual appeal.
