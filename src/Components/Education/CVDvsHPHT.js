              while both CVD and HPHT methods result in high-quality lab-grown
              diamonds, understanding their unique processes and characteristics
              can help consumers make informed choices based on their
              preferences and values.

            <p>
              Whether it's the controlled precision of CVD or the
              Earth-mimicking conditions of HPHT, the world of lab-grown
              diamonds offers a dazzling array of sustainable and ethical
              options for the modern consumer.

            <h6>CVD also known as TYPE2A Diamonds where HPHT known as TYPE2</h6>
            <h6>Formation Method</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>
                CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition): Carbon vapor is deposited onto
                a substrate to form diamonds.
              </li>
              <li>
                HPHT (High Pressure High Temperature): Mimics natural
                conditions, subjecting carbon to high pressure and high
                temperature to crystallize into diamonds.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h6>Process Complexity</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>
                CVD: Allows for precise control over diamond characteristics,
                including size and purity.
              </li>
              <li>
                HPHT: Mimics natural diamond formation, potentially leading to
                larger crystals but with less control over specific traits.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h6>Time Frame</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>CVD: Typically faster growth process.</li>
              <li>HPHT: May require longer processing times.</li>
            </ul>
            <h6>Energy Consumption</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>CVD: Generally considered more energy-efficient.</li>
              <li>
                HPHT: May require higher energy inputs due to the extreme
                conditions involved.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h6>Appearance</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>
                CVD and HPHT: Both result in diamonds with nearly identical
                physical, chemical, and optical properties.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h6>Cost</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>
                CVD: Costs may vary based on the specific conditions and
                equipment used.{' '}
              </li>
              <li>
                HPHT: Can be cost-effective due to better control over the
                growth process.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Major Difference is about Hardness, CVD has{' '}
              <b>
                10 on the Mohs scale of hardness, Where HPHT is close to 10 on
                the Mohs scale of hardness but Not 10,
              </b>{' '}
              So they react differently on Basic Diamond tester Pen(E.g.
              Presidium) ,
            </p>
            <p>
              CVD will show as diamond on diamond tester but HPHT will not show
              as diamond on diamond tester
            </p>
